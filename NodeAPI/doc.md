# Node API


# WIDGETS

        
This is a list of widgets and their associated attributes to aid in
        parameterizing and declaring widget.
        
###  GenericWidgetGroup
 This is the base-class for all widgets.  It provides abstract methods
     and default behavior.  From the node-developer's perspective, this
     provides the widget-port, visibility, and collapsibility options.
     
attribute | type | description
--- | --- | ---
 collapsed |  bool | Only hide the 'collapsable' elements of a  widget within its groupbox.
 id |  int | INTERNAL USE ONLY: used for saving network  information that will aid in reinstantiation.
 inport |  bool | Turn the widget inport on/off with a bool.
 outport |  bool | Turn the widget outport on/off with a bool.
 quietval |  (same type as val) | Set the central value of a widget without triggering an event.
 reset |  No Arg | Widgets that need to be reset automatically  implement this function (e.g. pushbuttons  where the button needs to be raised again  after the node compute()).
 val |  type(val) | Set the central value of a widget.
 visible |  bool | Set the widget groupbox's visibility within  the node menu.

###  ComboBox
 Provides a popup list for different labels.
     
attribute | type | description
--- | --- | ---
 index |  int | gives the corresponding index of the chosen item, starting at 0.  So, for example, self.getAttr('myfruitbox',index) would return a 2 if 'orange' were selected from the item list given in this table, while self.getVal('myfruitbox') would return the string 'orange'. 
 items |  list(str,str,...) | list of items to choose from. Only one item can be chosen from the list. 
 val |  int | item index

# PORT Types

        
The following types are used to define a node port for limiting the
        connection between nodes to the predefined port-types.  These labels are
        used when implementing `addInPort()` and `addOutPort()` port declaration
        functions.

        
### PASS

###   GLOList
 Allows passing GPI-GL object definitions to be passed in lists.
     

###   NPYarray
 The NPYarray type provides port enforcement for numpy
     multidimensional arrays (ndarray).  The enforcement parms
     are type (ndarray), dtype, ndim, dimension range (drange),
     shape, and vec (the len of the last dim).  Enforcement
     priority for aliased parms goes ndim->drange->shape.  Although
     shape and vec can overlap, they are enforced independently.
     
attribute | type | description
--- | --- | ---
 drange |  tuple(int,int) | Requires a dimension range tuple (min, max).
 dtype |  numpy dtype | Requires an NPY type (i.e. float32, complex64, etc...)
 ndim |  int | Set enforcement for the number of dimensions.  Requires (int).
 shape |  tuple(int,int,...) | Requires the dimension lengths in an integer tuple.
 vec |  int | Requires an integer representing the length of the last  (most varying) dimension (or shape[-1]).

###   COMPLEX
 Enforcement for the standard python-complex.

###   DICT
 Enforcement for the standard python-dict.

###   FLOAT
 Enforcement for the standard python-float.
     
attribute | type | description
--- | --- | ---
 range |  float | Specify a float range using a tuple (min, max).

###   INT
 Enforcement for the standard python-int.
attribute | type | description
--- | --- | ---
 range |  int | Specify an integer range using a tuple (min, max).

###   LIST
 Enforcement for the standard python-list.

###   LONG
 Enforcement for the standard python-long.
attribute | type | description
--- | --- | ---
 range |  tuple(int,int) | Specify an integer range using a tuple (min, max).

###   STRING
 Enforcement for the standard python-str.

###   TUPLE
 Enforcement for the standard python-tuple.



# GETTERS & SETTERS


        
Getters & Setters are functions that make up the node API.  They provide
        access to the UI elements (i.e. in-ports, out-ports, widgets).
        
## Node Initialization


        
These methods are used to declare in-ports, out-ports and widgets within
        the `initUI()` node method.
        
### addWidget
                addWidget(self, wdg=None, title=None, **kwargs)
                        wdg = (str) corresponds to the widget class name
                        title = (str) is the string label given in the node-menu
                        kwargs = corresponds to the set_<arg> methods specific
                                    to the chosen wdg-class.


### addInPort
                addInPort(self, title=None, type=None, obligation=100, menuWidget=None, cyclic=False, **kwargs)

                        obligation = gpi.REQUIRED or gpi.OPTIONAL (default REQUIRED)
                        menuWidget = INTERNAL USE
                        kwargs = any set_<arg> method belonging to the
                                    GPIDefaultType derived class.


### addOutPort
                addOutPort(self, title=None, type=None, obligation=100, menuWidget=None, **kwargs)
                        title = (str) port-title shown in tooltips
                        type = (str) class name of extended type
                        obligation = dummy parm to match function footprint
                        menuWidget = INTERNAL USE
                        kwargs = any set_<arg> method belonging to the
                                    GPIDefaultType derived class.


## Node Compute


        
These methods are used to reference data from in-ports, out-ports and widgets
        within the `compute()` routine.
        
### getVal
                getVal(self, title)
                        Returns get_val() from wdg-class (see getAttr()).
                                


### getAttr
                getAttr(self, title, attr)
                        title = (str) wdg-class name
                        attr = (str) corresponds to the get_<arg> of the desired attribute.


### setAttr
                setAttr(self, title, **kwargs)
                        title = (str) the corresponding widget name.
                        kwargs = args corresponding to the get_<arg> methods of the wdg-class.


### getData
                getData(self, title)
                        title = (str) the name of the InPort.
                                


### setData
                setData(self, title, data)
                        title = (str) name of the OutPort to send the object reference.
                        data = (object) any object corresponding to a GPIType class.
